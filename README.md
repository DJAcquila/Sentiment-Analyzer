# Sentiment-Analyzer
A Sentiment Analyzer for texts using the [Naive-Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
## Dependencies
- ```Python 3.6.8```
- The Natural Language Processing library ```NLTK 3.4``` 
- Speech Recognition library ```SpeechRecognition 3.8.1```
- To get the microphone ```PyAudio 0.2.11```

## Instalation Guide
To succeed with code execution, follow these steps:

Install python3:
```bash 
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04, Python 3.6 is not in the Universe repository, and you need to get it from a Personal Package Archive (PPA):
```bash
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
Install pip:
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Optionally install numpy
```bash 
  $ pip3 install --user -U numpy 
```
Install the virtual enviroment library
```bash
  $ pip3 install virtualenv
```
Create and start the virtual enviroment
```bash
  $ python3 -m venv env
  $ source env/bin/activate
```
Install the requirements inside the virtual enviroment
```bash
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Test if the requirements are satisfied ```python3``` on terminal and insert 
```python
import nltk
import speech_recognition as sr 
```

Download the needed data, type the following on terminal:
```bash 
 $ python -m nltk.downloader movie_reviews punkt
```
## Running the code
To run the script you can type ```python3 main.py``` on terminal and follow the instructions during the execution. The experience will be better with a microphone pluged.
